==================

------------------
Forked from Rael Gugelmin Cunha's @ https://github.com/raelgc/gedit-restore-tabs and fixes some issues.

------------------

This is a plugin for [Gedit][1], the official text editor of the GNOME desktop
environment.

This plugin is for Gedit versions 3 and above (including 3.8 and 3.10, included in Ubuntu 14.04).

**This plugin is NOT compatible with Gedit 2.x**.

Upon starting Gedit, this plugin will try restore all open documents from the
*last* Gedit window that was closed.
